       <h1>A quote by Albert Einstein </h1>

       <h2>“Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.”

― Albert Einstein</h2>

<p>I think that Albert Einstein's quote means that if someone is trying really hard to be smart and you judge them they will live their whole life thinking that they are stupid. His quote also tells us not to judge others. </p>
